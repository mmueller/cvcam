Build instructions (typical cmake project):

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Run:

    ./object-tracker [video-stream-url-or-file]

Foscam MJPEG stream URL example (needs to be enabled first! call
setSubStreamType with 1 (MJPEG) instead of the default 0 (h264)):

 http://foscam:88/cgi-bin/CGIStream.cgi?cmd=GetMJStream&usr=user&pwd=pass#x.mjpg

The #x.mjpg has no effect except to trick OpenCV's VideoCapture into treating
the stream as MJPEG. (It looks for a filename suffix, I guess.)

Foscam RTSP stream URL example (usually doesn't work as well):

 rtsp://user:pass@foscam:88/videoMain

By the way, this code is probably horrible. I'm a novice at this whole
computer vision thing and decided to just hack around until I had something
that sort of works. I'm going to hit the books now and start learning how the
professionals do this sort of thing.
